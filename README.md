## Script with Python API for Metashape
This is a proof of concept that our Team 11 realized for the course "Droni per il rilievo territoriale e architettonico" at Politecnico di Torino.
We automated the photo alignment, the creation and elaboration of the point cloud with Agisoft Metashape 2.1.1 using Python 3.11.
